What is this App  
This is an IOS Prototype App that i created with my team during the Apple Foundation Program (AFP), the first collaboration program between Apple and Universit√† degli studi di Palermo (UNIPA).
The goal of this Course was to work in small teams to make an idea to an IOS App that would possibily resolve a real life problem.
In this case me and my team through some interviews to "Unione Italiana per i ciechi e ipovedenti" developed and presented to the Apple a prototype that allow everyone, blind, 
visually impared and visually healthy to enjoy the art and the monuments in Palermo (in Sicily, Italy).

How this app works     
It uses the camera to recognize the monument you are framing and automaticaly shows the story of that place.

Who is the target
Potentialy it's usable for everyone but we paid attention to allow blind and visually impared people to use our app through a simple UI and the Apple VoiceOver.
