# What this app is         
This is an IOS Prototype App that i created with my team during the **Apple Foundation Program (AFP)**, the first collaboration program between **Apple** and **Universit√† degli studi di Palermo (UNIPA)**.
The goal of this Course was to work in small teams to make an idea to an IOS App that would possibily resolve a real life problem.
In this case me and my team through some interviews to "Unione Italiana per i ciechi e ipovedenti" developed and presented to the **Apple** a prototype that allow everyone, blind, 
visually impared and visually healthy to enjoy the art and the monuments in Palermo (in Sicily, Italy).

# What it does
It recognizes the monument you are framing with tha camera and automaticaly shows the story of that place.

# How it works
It uses a Machine learning model to recognize what the camera is framing. We used Coreml and Createml for this purpose

# Who is the target 
It's potentially usable for everyone but we paid attention to allow blind and visually impaired people to use our app through a simple UI and the Apple VoiceOver.
